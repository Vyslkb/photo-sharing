# Project 2: photo-sharing app
A photo sharing application built in Ruby on Rails v. 4
This app allows users to upload their photos with a comment in a simple and intuitive interface.


Development Story:

Technologies Used:
-Ruby on Rails

-[Devise](https://github.com/plataformatec/devise) for Authentication and RESTful routes.

-[Paperclip](https://github.com/thoughtbot/paperclip) for photo file attachment management for ActiveRecord

-CSS(Frameworks: Foundation.css, Normalize.css)

-JavScript(jQuery, Foundation.js)
